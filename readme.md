**Production-ready Java CI/CD pipeline featuring modern DevOps practices with Docker & Jenkins**

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline** for a Java application.  
It automates the entire software lifecycle — **building, testing, containerizing, and deploying** — using industry-standard tools.  

The goal is to provide a **production-ready workflow** that highlights how modern DevOps practices can streamline software delivery, reduce errors, and speed up deployments.
